To Do:
-Clamp camera to L/R of map (so we can't see where map ends, top/btm already done)
-Change character scaling to depend on what's eaten (currently scales a static
amount no matter what you eat. Maybe have what's eaten pass info on about it's
size?)
-Add parasite parent class (affects host over time)
-Add bad health parasite sub class (shrinks host) 
-Add bad speed parasite sub class (slows host)
-Add bad appetite parasite sub class (allows you to be eaten by things 20%
smaller than you) 
-Add good health parasite sub class (grows host) 
-Add good speed parasite sub class (speeds up host)
-Add good appetite parasite sub class (allows you to eat things 20%
bigger than you) 
-Create menus (partially done)
-More SPRITES!
-Environmental hazards (tornadoes, dust storms, etc.)
-Multiplayer

Done:
-Add sounds (for player)
-Enemy return to game space (after leaving camera)
-Fix enemy collision box scaling issue (it scales faster than the sprite)
-Make map larger than camera view
-Have player always at center of screen
-Movement animation
-Collision detection on enemies (so they can eat each other)
-Enemy spawns outside of screenview and moves across screen
-Main character movement
-Create GameController class to control events
-Create enemy prefab
-Create enemy spawning mechanism
